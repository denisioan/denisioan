Skilled and experienced senior software developer, project manager and entrepreneur. I’ve spent the last 20 years developing worldwide solutions on cash handling solutions (Deposit Systems, Smart Safes and Vending Machines) and blockchain/DeFi practical integrations.

I like to challenge myself every day seeking new opportunities and improving my skills to reach new objectives to achieve. I like to put passion and energy in all the projects where I’m involved. I like to work in team because it’s the best way to leverage the individual performance. 

I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect.
